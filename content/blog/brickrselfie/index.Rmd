[Ryan Timpe](http://www.ryantimpe.com/) has done great job with his `brickr` package. Now living in the `Denmark`, the only think I knew about the `Denmark` was the `LEGO` toys :).

Now thanks to his `Brickr` package now you can build the Musiac of the your selfie. Fist, I found about this capability from `Ryan` tweet, here:

```{r echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1247862505944145921")
```

Now, I am going to make my own one :)

The first thing you need to do is load the package:


```{r}
# If you have not installed the package
#install.packages('brickr')
library(brickr)
```

Then, next step is to read and upload your photo, I am planning to use this photo:

```{r echo = FALSE} 
xfun::embed_files("selfie.png", name = "selfie.png")
```

![](selfie.png)
Ok, now you have the `selfie.png` at your directory, we need to read it through the `png`:

```{r}
awseome_selfie <- png::readPNG("selfie.png")
```

Ok, now having that, the next step you must take is some `pipe` as the below:

```{r, message=FALSE}
awseome_selfie %>% 
  image_to_mosaic(img_size = 62) %>% 
  build_mosaic()
```
