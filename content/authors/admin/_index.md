# Peyman Kor

Hi, I am Peyman Kor working on to connect Data Science with real world challenges to make impact. I do belive the ability get sense out of messy Data is a super power that could add significant value to any analytic team. :fire:

## My values

🌟 Innate sense of curiosity and love of learning<br>
💖 Love of sharing and serving the community<br>
🍏 Praise in public, criticize in private- always<br>
🙌 Clear Communication to have shared understanding and consensus

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸



## Some past projects:

- 📜 {danparcorpR} - an R package providing more thatn 300,000 speeches of Danish parlmant, in Tidy format - [Link](https://peymankor.github.io/danparcorpR/)
- 📈 {website} - Master Thesis on Application of Development of XGBOOST model for Making Informed Decison in Engineering Process - [Link](https://bookdown.org/kor_peyman/masterthesisuis/)
