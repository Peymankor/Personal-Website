I am an M.sc degree student in Mathematical Modelling and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark and Data Scientist at a start-up company, [Decarbonify](https://decarbonify.com/). I am going to finish my degree in June 2020. In addition to my current role, I got my first master degree in Engineering from the [University of Stavanger](https://uis.no/), Norway. For my first M.Sc degree, I worked on "Decision-Driven Data Analytics" with application in the Energy industry under the Supervision of [Reidar B. Bratvold](http://www.reidar-bratvold.com/) and [Aojie Hong](https://www.uis.no/article.php?articleID=89547&categoryID=11198). The full text of the publication is available in the M.Sc thesis [Website](https://bookdown.org/kor_peyman/masterthesisuis/).

My area of interest is R and Python Programming for Descriptive and Predictive Analytics. In my Github portfolio I provided multiple of my data science projects written in R, Python and SQL query language. On the Deep Learning side, I did a project with [Ole Winther](https://www.dtu.dk/english/service/phonebook/person?id=10167&tab=1) on the "Bayesian Uncertainty quantification in Neural Networks" aiming to provide BayesBackprop as a new method for Regularization. The project was documented in this [repo](https://github.com/Peymankor/Data-Science_Portfolio/tree/master/BNN-Project).


In the end, I find myself both a highly collaborative team player with an enthusiasm to work independently and a flexible attitude accustomed to working in an agile development environment. I enjoy brainstorming and discovering the business opportunities to be addressed through the data-driven approach.
